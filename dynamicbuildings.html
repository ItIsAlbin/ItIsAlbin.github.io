        <h2>Dynamic Buildings</h2>
        <p>
            An Unity editor, artist friendly, tool that enables you to 'draw' up buildings, re-position them and change them in any way you like; including shape, window layouts and materials. All properties of a building are stored in a special template class, so it's easy to save building-presets and in real-time copy/paste from one building to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once happy with the layout, chains of buildings can either be 'frozen', to save up cpu, or completly be turned into rigid geometry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Focus has been put into making the tool intuitive, while still trying to enable smaller changes, when wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intended for level mock-ups, background props, or games that don't need AAA-level geometry.
