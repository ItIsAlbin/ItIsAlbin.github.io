      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a free-time indie game developer and currently studing to become a web developer at Yrgo, Göteborg. My
        background is in art and design, the latter in which I also hold an univeristy bachelor degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been working with 3d-software, mostly Autodesk Maya, for about 15 years and Unity the last 8+ years,
        learning C# as I go along. Alongside this I also enjoy drawing/painting, be it digital or on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus has usually been 3d modeling, although I also enjoy doing animation from time to time. Topics
        tends to lean towards architecture (cities in general), people and some occasional sci-fi.
      </p>
      <p>I also play and write music, enjoy learning languages and hang out with my part time dog.</p>
