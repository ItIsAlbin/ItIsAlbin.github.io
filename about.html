        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a hobby indie game developer from Sweden with a background in art and design, the latter in which I also hold an univeristy degree.</p>
        <p>I've been working with 3d-software, mostly Autodesk Maya, for about 15 years and Unity the last 5+ years, learning C# as I go along. Alongside this I also enjoy drawing/painting, be it digital or on paper.</p>
        <p>My main focus is usually 3d modeling, although I also enjoy doing animation from time to time. Topics tends to lean towards architecture (cities in general), people and some occasional sci-fi.</p>
        <p>I also play and write music, enjoy learning languages and to walk my dog.</p>
